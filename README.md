## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This exercise was much smoother than the previous "stats preview card". I felt the code was much more organized and my approach was more systematic. There was much less media query specific code and more code shared between each view.
